# Algorithmic Complexity

## Algorithms

### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a well defined computation to solve a problem with a computer program.

It solves a computational problem with a series of computations described by:

- a precondition (the Input of the algorithm)
- a postcondition (expected output)

### Examples

- sorting algorithms
  - quicksort
  - heapsort
- graphing algorithms
  - dijkstra's shortest path
  - A*
  - Bellman-Ford algorithm
- search algorithms
  - linear search
  - binary search
