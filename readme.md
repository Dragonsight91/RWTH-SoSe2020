# The Computer Science study materials repository

## What is this repository?

It is a collection of files, including exercises, lecture slides and my personal notes, where I made them.
This Repository is no more than an accumulation of materials to help people learn.

## That thing is wrong, it should be fixed.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS REPO MAY CONTAIN SOLUTIONS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE CORRECT!!**

I am but a humble student. If you think something is wrong, open an issue, explaining the problem and maybe send a PR, if you wanna fix it yourself.

## All of these Lectures, but no Videos!!

Many videos can be found at the [RWTH FSMPI website](https://video.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de) and will be linked in each directory's `readme.md`.
I cannot however upload the videos from moodle, which is why i try to have as much information and as many explanations in the notes.

## All of those Lectures are in german

Sorry, i wish it all was in english, but i can't change it either. If you need it in english, look at the Notes
